Alternate authentication in biometric

ALTERNATE AUTHENTICATION
            Nowadays ,passwords can be easily cracked,and they are not secured.
            To try and make password more secure,consumers are asked to make them more complex,by using numbers,uppercase,lowercase letters and special characters.This makes the people hard to remember.
            If suppose  a strangers person  knows our password they can hack it easily.
            Our intension is about,avoiding those consequences occurred, by using biometric authentication like iris and fingerprint scanner.
	          It adds next level security.

USE SEGERMENT AND PAIN POINT
           Both clients and banks need an easy , secure , fast and convenient way to ensure the security of transactions as passwords are not reliable or secure in practice
           The driving factor for adoption of biometrics in banking transaction is that it shortens authentication times across both channels and devices 
           Customers benefit is they need not to carry accessible cards for all the places
	         Work stress is less for bank sectors
           No complexity in choosing a password
 PRE REQUISTE
      IF ANYONE ACCESS OUR BANK DETAILS:
           Using Calls-A precautionary calls alert to us ,if anybody access our account
           Using Messages-safeguard messages awake us
           Using OTP-One Time Password are also used to make us lively
           Using Cards- Using of identification cards we may access our accounts without passwords

 Any Supporting Functional Documents
           No physical contact when scanning.

           For fingerprint,we use verihand technology method that creates pure digital identity.

           This technology  is total contactless and hygienic scanning process.

           Unlike other biometrics,our solution doesn’t leave fingerprint traces and handprint traces in any surface that can be copied.
  Key Differentiators & Adoption Plan
          
           Strong authentication

           There is no need to remember our password or pin numbers

           No need to carry any accessories

           Say goodbye to passwords

           Non-transferable
 
           Biometric payments is said to be 99.99% accurate
